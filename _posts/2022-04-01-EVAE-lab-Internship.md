 - Cooperated with the IT department of IHU, to host and create a
   Wordpress website for the [EVAE](http://evael.vt.teithe.gr/) academic laboratory.  This cooperation taught me how to work with Filezilla, Wordpress and servers to install and make functional sites.
   
 - Configured the QGroundControl software for the ROVs from Blue Robotics of the laboratory
   along with the necessary wired controller and proceeded to check the
   functionality of the vehicle and any possible maintenance it might
   need. Disassembled the vehicle's motors, cleaned them from any
   residue, put them back in place and configured them. Also the camera
    [module](https://bluerobotics.com/store/sensors-cameras/cameras/cam-usb-low-light-r1/) USB to JST connector disconnected so I placed a new connector after cleaning the area from solder, fixing the camera module video output.
   
 - Regularly performed maintenance on the laboratory's electrically
   assisted bicycles and tricycles, making myself comfortable in tasks
   like changing bicycle tires, changing chains and troubleshooting
   electrical vehicle drivetrain components.
   
 - Also performed maintenance and repairs at computers or
   educational equipment belonging to the lab as needed and pointed by the supervisor professors each time.
 
 - Gathered all necessary paperwork for Greek students participating in
   the lab's Erasmus plus programs and informed them accordingly on a
   regular basis about the program they were participating and the
   obligations from their part.
   
 - Assisting in teaching a practical laboratory course in the Smartsea
   postgraduate degree focused on Arduino microcontrollers and marine
   engineering sensors. Demonstrated to students the basics of Arduino
   programming and assisted them in creating a series of circuits and
   programs to check several functions like water temperature or how to
   find motor speed underwater.
   
 - Created carbon fiber pieces for vehicles like an electric cart and in
   the process of creating video tutorials for masters students on the procedure.
   
 - Represented the lab in the Thessaloniki International Fair and the
   Beyond Exhibition ([more about that on this post](https://maro-michailidou.eu/tif-beyond/)).
 - Helped setup and calibrate a 3D printer [Flashforge Creator 3](https://www.flashforge.com/product-detail/flashforge-creator-3-fdm-3d-printer) for
   the lab of [Electronics and Energy Harvesting of IHU.](http://microengineering.iem.ihu.gr/) Printed my thesis project's enclosure there after the guidance of the supervising professor Dr.Kiziroglou.
