During my participation in the Erasmus plus program [Edrivetour](https://www.edrivetour.eu/) I attended a mobility period in Warsaw, Poland where I and several of my peers had the amazing opportunity to intern at the span of two weeks in the micromobility company called [Triggo](https://www.triggo.city/) who has actually developed their own prototyped electric vehicle ideal for urban areas. 

For the duration of two weeks there my main task was building a machine learning object detection model. Without going into too many details the purpose of the model was the detection of a triggo vehicle through a camera module and its resulting image data. So while I was there, I familiriased myself with machine learning models used for autonomous driving, manually prepared and cleaned a dataset of images for the object detection task, created and programmed functions in python for the evaluation of the model's performance and accuracy, a task which took quite a while, and then I proceeded with extending and augmenting the dataset I had previously prepared to see if perhaps I could
raise the machine learning model's accuracy even further. 

As a second task for my internship I also helped with troubleshooting a faulty speed controller PCB along with performing SMD soldering of parts to bring it back to working condition. Then I also followed a lecture and practical demonstration on how to simulate circuits with comparators and LTspice and went ahead and created a working example on a breadboard from a provided schematic.

It should be noted that throughout my internship I was guided through these projects and tasks by professionals working at the time in the company, a fact for which I am severely thankful since they were beyond helpful and understanding with all of my questions on both projects and really helped guide me to become a better engineer.
