During my internship at EVAE lab of the International Hellenic University I was fortunate enough to represent the academic lab at Thessaloniki International Fair and Beyond Exposition. There for a week I was presenting labatorial equipment and projects to attendants along with informing them about University events. I had a similar role at the Beyond exhibition with the attendants this time being a more professional crowd and myself having the opportunity to talk with local companies in the field of engineering. I'm beyond thankful, no pun intended there, to participate and represent my place of work in these two exhibitions.
