All the necessary files and documents collected for the Intermediate Project of the [E-DRIVETOUR](https://www.edrivetour.eu/) Erasmus programme and the according IEEE paper published on the 7th [International Workshop on Microsystems](http://microengineering.iem.ihu.gr/WoMGREECE/index.html) and presented at Dec 14, 2022.

The projects  were a necessary part for the certification process of [ECQA](https://jobcertification.eu/index.php)  and that is why two [OpenSpace3D](https://www.openspace3d.com/) augmented reality apps were created alongside the 3D modelling of two different vehicles with all the relevant technical data and specifications needed for the writing of the academic paper. 

 The projects have been elaborated during its two mobility periods, the first at the premises of the [International Hellenic University](https://www.ihu.gr/en/enhome) in Thessaloniki, Greece and the second
at the [University of Technology and Humanities in Radom](https://uniwersytetradom.pl/?lang=en), Poland. The EDRIVETOUR program focused on educating undergraduate engineering students from different fields of study such as mechanical or electrical engineering, in the
matter of electromobility and modern technologies. During the mobility periods various procedures such as the development of augmented reality applications, collection of technical specifications and datasheets of electric vehicles, 3D modelling and the troubleshooting of a battery assisted Tad-pole tricycle
and a Hybrid Toyota Yaris have been overseen.

## Engine 
The 1NZFXE combined engine 3D design showing the characteristic planetary gear of the power split device of the vehicle and in the front the two alternating current synchronous motors is available in the Toyota Hybrid Engine.stl file.

## Battery 
The 3D model of backup lead-acid 12v battery and the lithium-ion battery consisting of 48 cells reaching the nominal voltage of 177.6 V and its coolant system are also available in the Hybrid Battery.stl file.

## Throttle Simulation
The AR application made with OpenSpace3D, simulates a throttle circuit of an electric vehicle
using an Arduino Uno microcontroller as a potentiometer for throttle output and displaying its reading to the OpenSpace3D's user interface. At the same time, another circuit with an Adafruit LCD screen Arduino shield was used to appear the throttle data to the driver in real time allowing for better driving and steering of the vehicle.
