Fullfilled the courses on HTML, CSS and object-oriented Javascript and provided community support to a satisfactory degree to be chosen to attend the second phase of the program. For the next six months of the program, I completed the necessary courses on front end web development frameworks like ReactJS and Angular plus unit testing, accessibility, and version control with Git.
