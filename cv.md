## Work experience:

 - **EVAE LAB / Internship (2022)** 
   
   Support in undergraduate and post graduate laboratory courses.
   Installation and maintenance of educational equipment. Collection and
   submission of Erasmus plus documents. Representation of the
   laboratory at the International Thessaloniki Fair and Beyond 22
   exhibition.
 - **Triggo S.A. / Short-term Internship (2022)**
   
   Creation of a machine learning model of Object Detection from start
   to finish with Tensorflow for Triggo vehicles. The whole project was

## **University Degree:**

 **International Hellenic University / Automation Engineering Degree (2016-2022)**

 Bachelor’s degree with focus on Electrical and Electronics engineering,
Mechatronics, Industrial Control Systems, SCADA and HMI solutions.

## Thesis Project:

**Scattering measurements with the
Beaglebone microcomputer for portable
biomedical sensors (2022)** 

Design, fabrication and writing CE technical files for a prototype of a non-invasive, portable, Mie scattering based blood quality sensor. The aforementioned prototype device consists of a 1500×1-pixel photodiode array sensor, a
650 nm laser diode, and a novel case designed in order to easily facilitate various kinds of future optical experiments. In addition, I was in charge of planning several in-vivo and in-vitro experiments and examining other possible biomedical applications for the device.


## **Certifications:**

 - **ECQA CERTIFICATE of Sustainable Electric Mobility Engineering Expert (2022)**
   
   Certification on the knowledge of Vehicle Electrification based on
   the E-DRIVE-TOUR Erasmus plus programme with cooperation from the
   University of Craiova and the University of Radom.
   
   
 - **Udacity / Front End Web Development Nanodegree (2018)**

   
   Certification on Front End Web Development in which 7 projects where
   submitted made with HTML, CSS, React JS and Angular.
   

 - **Udacity / AWS Machine Learning Basics Nanodegree (2021)**


   Certification of machine learning basics with Python and TensorFlow.
